#ADA Compliant Theme for ActiveData
##By Tarrant County College

###Project Scope

This is an attempt to create a completely accessible theme for the ActiveData calendar service used by TCC.

###Editing the Project

The template code is in the `src` directory. The documentation provided by ActiveData is available in the office on the shared Training drive. Do not include the docs with this repo.

This project utilizes Node and Grunt. Be sure Node is installed on your system first, then install the Grunt command line tools using:

`npm install grunt-cli -g`

Clone this project, then change to the project directory. Install the dev dependencies using:

`npm install`

After making changes to the project, type `grunt` on the command line to generate a theme package ZIP in the `dist/` folder that can be uploaded to ActiveData and activated as the custom layout.
